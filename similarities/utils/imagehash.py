    Creates a CropResistantHash object, by the algorithm described in the paper "Efficient Cropping-Resistant Robust
    Image Hashing". DOI 10.1109/ARES.2014.85
    This algorithm partitions the image into bright and dark segments, using a watershed-like algorithm, and then does
    an image hash on each segment. This makes the image much more resistant to cropping than other algorithms, with
    the paper claiming resistance to up to 50% cropping, while most other algorithms stop at about 5% cropping.
    Note: Slightly different segmentations are produced when using pillow version 6 vs. >=7, due to a change in
    rounding in the greyscale conversion. This leads to a slightly different result.
